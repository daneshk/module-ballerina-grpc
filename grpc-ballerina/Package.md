## Package Overview

The `grpc` library is one of the standard library packages of the <a target="_blank" href="https://ballerina.io/">Ballerina</a> language.

This package provides support for the gRPC messaging protocol. gRPC is an inter-process communication technology
 that allows you to connect, invoke, and operate distributed, heterogeneous applications as easily as making a local function call. The gRPC protocol is layered over HTTP/2 and uses Protocol Buffers for marshaling/unmarshaling messages. This makes gRPC highly efficient on wire and a simple service definition framework.
